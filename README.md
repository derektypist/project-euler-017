# Project Euler 017 - Number Letter Counts

If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.

The aim is to find out how many letters are used if all the numbers from 1 to n (e.g. 1000) inclusive were written out in words.

**NOTE:** Do not include spaces or hyphens.  For example 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters.  The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.
